<p>It's a puzzle game with a narrative about a cat's journey of regaining freedom from narrowly defined gender
    expectations and embracing the cat sexuality spectrum.</p>
<p>The game is called Free Again because while children's minds were free from rigid conceptions about the world
    (sexuality included), adults' hearts are locked by rigid ideas;  the spectrum, among other similar ideas,
    removes some rigidity from how we perceive the world, and make us freer just as we were children.</p>
<p>It's happily made for the #<a href="https://itch.io/jam/rainbowjam17" target="_blank">RainbowJam2017</a> ^^<br>
